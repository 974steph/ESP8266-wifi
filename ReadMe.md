This is one of my first sketches, it is rough around the edges but seems to work well enough.   Features include:


1. Control up to 250 LEDs with animation support, more without animations.
2. MQTT commands control mostly everything.
3. Web Interface does control everything.
4. Control LEDs using ADALIGHT via serial, DMX or UDP via wifi. 
5. 9 different, highly customisable effects and animations. 
6. LED configurations in strips, or spiral, (grid support not implemented yet). 
7. 10 effects can be saved to EEPROM along with their configuration.
